### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Benedikt (he/him)!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
  - Using a modified version of [Agentpy](https://github.com/JoelForamitti/agentpy) to model tooth decay in kids between the ages of 0-6.
  - EdTech software with Harvard Department of Continuing Education
  - A small personal website written with TypeScript and React
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
  - [Algorithms for Optimization](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262039420/) and other related math
  - Rust entity-component systems, actor-models, agent-based models, and more machine learning techniques
  - C for networking like [Nginx](https://github.com/nginx/nginx); starting with [Beej](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/)
  - Maybe some Rust or C operating system stuff...

To see what I've recently been learning or working on the side, check out my [personal projects repo](https://github.com/Benni-Math/personal_projects). I'm also working towards a personal website (still in the works).

I'm a recently graduated math major and computer science minor. I used to be very interested in number theory (Langlands and arithmetic geometry), but now I'm focused on all things computer science and software engineering.
