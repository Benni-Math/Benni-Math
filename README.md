To see what I've recently been learning or working on the side, check out my [personal projects repo](https://github.com/Benni-Math/personal_projects).

I'm a recently graduated math major and computer science minor. I used to be very interested in number theory (Langlands and arithmetic geometry), but now I'm focused on all things computer science and software engineering.
