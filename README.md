### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Benedikt (he/him)! I'm a recently graduated math major and computer science minor. I used to be very interested in number theory (Langlands and arithmetic geometry), but now I'm focused on all things computer science and software engineering.

  - Using a modified version of [Agentpy](https://github.com/JoelForamitti/agentpy) to model tooth decay in kids between the ages of 0-6.
  - EdTech software with Harvard Department of Continuing Education
  - A small personal website written with TypeScript and React (on-hold/in-purgatory)
  
Also, check out my [personal projects repo](https://github.com/Benni-Math/personal_projects).
