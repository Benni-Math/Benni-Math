### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Benedikt (he/him)! I'm a recently graduated math major and computer science minor. I used to be very interested in number theory (Langlands and arithmetic geometry, with a dash of higher homotopy theory), but now I'm focused on all things computer science and software engineering.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
  - Using a modified version of [Agentpy](https://github.com/JoelForamitti/agentpy) to model tooth decay in kids between the ages of 0-6.
  - EdTech software with Harvard Department of Continuing Education
  - Kafka and Cassandra development

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
  - Developer tooling and programming language theory
  - CI/CD, testings, and general deployment strategies
  - Home servers
