### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Benedikt (he/him)! I'm a somewhat-recently graduated math major and computer science minor. I used to be very interested in number theory (Langlands and arithmetic geometry, with a dash of higher homotopy theory), but now I'm focused on all things computer science and software engineering, with an emphasis on backend, DevOps, and MLOps.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
  - Using a modified version of [Agentpy](https://github.com/JoelForamitti/agentpy) to model tooth decay in kids between the ages of 0-6. (Python)
  - EdTech software with Harvard Department of Continuing Education (TypeScript/React)
  - Kafka and Cassandra development (Java/Spring)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
  - Nix (the package manager and programming language)
  - Kubernetes
  - Entity component systems and linear algebra libraries (in Rust)
  - Lean4 Theorem Prover
