### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Benedikt!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
  - Agent-based modelling with the Center for Mind and Culture
  - EdTech Software with Harvard Department of Continuing Education
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
  - Rust (and a little C++)
  - TypeScript and functional programming 
  - General Web-Dev (tools, frameworks, etc.)

To see what I've recently been learning or working on the side, check out my [personal projects repo](https://github.com/Benni-Math/personal_projects).

I'm a recently graduated math major and computer science minor. I used to be very interested in number theory (Langlands and arithmetic geometry), but now I'm focused on all things computer science and software engineering. I really appreciate the intersection of abstract math and computer science!
